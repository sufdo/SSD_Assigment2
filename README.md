SSD_Assignment 2 : Use of OAuth 2.0 Framework

Here we have implemented a web application that consumes the service of an OAuth Authorization Server and an OAuth Resource Server. 

1. To run the project you have to install node.js. Link :  https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. For all the GET and POST requests for the resource server use the add-on Postman Chrome.
